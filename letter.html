    <div class="date" style="text-align:right; color:#bfa76a; font-size:1rem; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">June 8th, 2025</div>
    <div class="letter">
      <p>ri i wanted to write you this because it's our first anniversary not together, and i felt the need to look back at some of my favorite moments with you sweetie. this is gonna be my brain dump of feels in place of having u in my arms (let me preface that this is not written well)</p>
      <p>march 8th, 2025, 2:02 am. thats when i sent u a selfie of me n leah at the bar. idk if u realized it then, but you know now that we were COOKING up the next days events. i wasnt sure what to expect having had multiple rejections by this point, but i was not gonna let someone like u slip through unless i put it all out there so I was READY for our next day. literally the whole time from e ramen to wagaya through our conversation all the way to the culc i was so nervous because i was coming to terms with the fact that i was gonna get that 4th rejection and the pursuit of ri was gonna end. i was being hella nonchalant ofc but i was GEEKINGGGGGG when you said u wanted to start dating me like how tf did i pull this MODEL. i wish i couldve spent all night with u but the function called (i didnt say it then but i highkey wanted to bail on it to be with you).</p>
      <p>fast forward 4 days and we r sitting on the top of the parking deck and you've got the super cute ri sweater on with ur white loafers and all the trinkets on (such a sexy bi fit). i remember being so nervous to pull the lemme see ur jewelry line because we never initiated anything even remotely close to that but alas fuck it we ball prevailed and im so unbelievably happy it did. i remember u laughing at me but i was lowkey tweaking prayyying i wasnt making u feel uncomfy. oh and the fact THAT I WAS HOLDING THE HOTTEST GIRL IVE EVER SEENS HAND. not to mention ur jewelry be giving me all the sensory yums.</p>
      <p>we can skip over spring break because i was LACKING in ri then but i love that we made time to talk. hearing you is soothing and makes me so happy. it doesnt matter what im doing talking to ri always makes things better. i love that i can check in with u and give u updates and hear ur updates and ahhh idk what im saying it just feels so right.</p>
      <p>some fweeky time, trivia, and garden adventure later, we r now sitting at kura eating SUSHIIIII. and whats that, is that, is that‚Ä¶ RAW SUSHI ON RIRIBABYS plate???? i think its amazing that ur starting to try new things and be honest about how u feel. also im looking at sushi pics as i write this and HOW are u so photogenic like i catch u off guard with pics SO MUCH and u always look incredible. ik u dont think it but know that i do. that night when u were drawing on my bed i felt so comfy and happy it was like such a simple activity but u just made it so amazing. you make me feel like i could do literally anything when i put down the wackest non artistic drawing and u gas me up so much. RIRIBABY is the BEST gf i could ever ask for.</p>
      <p>MIRROR PICS. YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN OUR MIRROR PICS. like genuinely not sure how u pull it off, esp when we just be getting outta bed and eepy, but u always looking soo good. i hope we never stop taking mirror pics till the end of time because it's just such a classic. unrelated but YOU ARE THE CAR WHISPERER. like maybe its cuz ur allergic and so they want more of u but all the cars love u ESPECIALLY SOCKS OUR CHILD. my baby is so brave she'll reach out and pet all da cars and give dem all da butt scratches. be careful with socks tho she be putting that thang out there</p>
      <p>getting off topic‚Ä¶.fast forward to the hive together. U TOOK ME TO YOUR HIVE, THE QUEEN FW ME! no but fr i could sit around and take wonky pics with you for hours and hours. AS LONG as ri is in the photo, cant have no bae photo sesh like that willage time. i will allow swapping our sunglasses because u look amazing in both</p>
      <p>circling back, BABE WE HELLA FWEEKY. anyways thats all there‚Ä¶‚Ä¶(feining to be fweeky w you again)</p>
      <p>fast forward april 25th, red top ri and green top bae are walking back in pouring rain and get some FIRE pics in the crc garage. ri carrying like ush cuz she looks SO GOOD. idk how u do it babe. but yea idk that night was like a dream it kinda felt like it was only us in the whole world trekking thru the nasty whether back to our humble abode. i think about how much i enjoyed that alot, just Ri and Bae vs the world.</p>
      <p>fast forward to april 26, JBREKK CONCERT. babe idk how else to say this but u looked SO FUCKING SEXY OH MY GOD. UR FIT UR MAKEUP JUST U IN LIKE WHATTT. its bizarre to me that i can be like yea thats my gf and show people u like what did i do to deserveeeee. and ofc dont think i forgot ur model photoshoot (thanks mandy) i mean u literally should have agencies lining up. im gonna die on this hill because its not fair to other girls how good u look. but yea i love being a concert couple with you. just swaying to music with you makes me feel so complete and whole and happy and WARM IN THE TUMMY. i wish i could do that with you everyday riribaby. cant wait for mit.</p>
      <p>April 29th: u let me wear the FULL ri hands fit. getting a taste of what its like to be looking peak (and bi) that time. never stop expressing yourself thru ur jewelry and other trinkets it's so truly YOU and i never want that to change. i think your maximalist approach to things that spark joy in you is just a testament to how big your heart is and it's my dream for u to take that next step with me and truly always feel me in there</p>
      <p>may 1: moving out was so sad because of what was impending but im so grateful of the time i got to spend with you. thats time that ill cherish and truly never forget. ik it's not the end but something about that last bit of time when we were both at school just feels different and i think it will for a long time. different, in a good way. i saw this reel that was like "copped one of these just in time for move out" and it's a girl recording her bf carrying all her stuff down and i thought of us lmaooo. if it were up to me you'd be lounging in one of those beach chairs outside, sunhat on, sunglasses on, sipping twea with a straw, watching me longingly while i went up and down getting all your things</p>
      <p>may: the rest of may was just a dream. i got to spend so much time with you, and among some scares and possibly some tough conversations, i've never had time better spent. ive also never had hurt like what it was when u werent with me, which is something that's new to me but at the same time highlights how incredible our time is together. wherever on the spectrum that is, lounging in bed all the way to celebrating something ur presence in my life completes me.</p>
      <p>i wont belay the point but i did wanna tell u something that i saw the other day. i think it's something along the lines of "you don't spend the rest of your life with someone you can live with, you spend the rest of your life with someone you can't live without". ik its corny and cheesy and u probably think im so insane for talking like this after 3 months, but if theres any truth to that then i feel like i could spent a really really long time with u, and the times we are apart go to show for that.</p>
      <p>the last thing i wanted to say is one of my biggest goals in life is for u to say ALL the things to me, and feel as tho the positive emotions i make u feel are consistent and lasting, and everyday im working to achieve this. to MANY more months with riribaby üíö</p>
